# Data Extraction Module

This module is responsible for extracting and processing circuit data from various sources. It consists of several Python scripts that work together to handle different aspects of data extraction and storage.

## Components

- `TimeLogicExtract.py`: Handles the extraction of timing and logic-related data from circuits
- `Component Details.py`: Processes and manages component-specific information
- `StoreData.py`: Manages data storage and persistence
- `main.py`: Main entry point for the data extraction process

## Usage

To use the data extraction module, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```
